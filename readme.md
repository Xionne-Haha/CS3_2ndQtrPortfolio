**Project Proposal**

1. A working website Title. The title should be short, catchy and would encapsulate what the website is about.  This title will be used on the website browser tab. *Gameboy Pedia*

2. A second title could be used to emphasize the importance of the website. *Pixel Perfect Information, A Catalogue of Game Information*

3. A logo for your website should also be designed. To be used in every page of the website and on the web browser tab (the favicon/icon).

4. A short but comprehensive description of the website using only one or two paragraphs.  This will be used as part of the homepage content of your website. *Gameboy Pedia is considered as your ultimate companion when it comes to exploring the world of video games. We provide the ever-updating information about every major type of games such as Horror, RPG, FPS and many many more. For each major genre, we offer in-depth analysis of two historically significant and genre-defining titles, detailing their design, impact and timeless-impact. This is a site that is designed for gamers, students or geeks seeking to understand the fundamental game designs through focused and concise studies.*

5. An outline of the website of at least 5 web pages.  Each outline should have a subtitle (Example: Home, Players, About Us, etc) The website should have a clear home page.  The outline should be descriptive and refrain from using Page 1, Page 2 or Link 1, Link 2.  The outline will be translated as the webpages of your website. 

*A. The Hub (Home)

Purpose: This page serves as the user's primary entry point, offering immediate site context and showcasing featured content to encourage exploration.

Content: The main site description (from homepage_description.md), a rotating "Featured Genre of the Month," and a "Spotlight Title" highlight pulled from one of the deep-dive analyses. It provides the highest-level summary of the site's mission and clear calls-to-action leading to the Genre Library. The page is designed for high visual impact and easy navigation.

B. Genre Library (Index)

Purpose: The central catalog where users can browse, filter, and access all documented genres.

Content: A comprehensive, interactive listing of every genre covered (e.g., Action RPG, Real-Time Strategy, First-Person Shooter). Each genre entry displays the official Gameboy Pedia definition and a key visual. Clicking any entry leads directly to that genre's full Deep Dives page for analysis. This acts as the encyclopedic table of contents.

C. Deep Dives (Analysis)

Purpose: To provide the in-depth, comparative analysis of the two defining games for each genre.

Content: This page is the destination for the site's core academic content. It begins with the full historical context and evolutionary timeline of the selected genre. The bulk of the page is dedicated to the side-by-side breakdown of the two chosen games, detailing their unique mechanics, design innovations, critical reception, and lasting influence on games that followed.

D. Design Lineage (Influence Map)

Purpose: To visualize the connections, evolutions, and cross-pollination between different video game genres.

Content: An interactive graphic or flow chart demonstrating the historical relationships between genres (e.g., how early Adventure games paved the way for modern Open World structures). It includes a "Genre Crossover" section that analyzes successful hybrid genres (like Survival Horror or Tactical RPGs) and discusses their combined mechanical DNA.

E. Archive and Contact (About Us)

Purpose: Transparency regarding the site's mission, methodology, and curator information.

Content: The full mission statement, a detailed explanation of the criteria used to select the two "historically significant" titles for analysis in each genre, and information about the editorial team (the "Curators"). This page also includes a simple, dedicated form for user inquiries, suggestions, or contact.

6. A description on how JS will be incorporated in your website or on one of the webpages.  It must clearly state where it will be used or found on the website.

7. An initial wireframe or mock-up for all the proposed webpages, showing clearly the layout, position of contents (text, images and media files), and the navigation between web pages.  The wireframe should also clearly show actual web pages’ titles and the section headers.  

9. Navigation design should allow users to switch between pages with ease from any of the pages.

10. Lastly, include a footer in your wireframe for copyright notices, source citations and Social Media Links using well known image sprites
