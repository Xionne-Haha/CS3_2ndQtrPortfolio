            <h2>RPG Games</h2>
            <p>
                RPG (Role-playing Games) are games where players assume the roles of characters in fictional settings. RPGs are usually defined by detailed storylines and character advancement. Combat is a defining part of RPGs, and this is usually shown through either turn-based combat, or real action combat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Video Game RPGs usually share the same terminology, settings, and game mechanics as tabletop RPGs. Players control game characters in RPGs, who carry out issued tasks or commands to varying success levels based on their attributes. Throughout the game, these attributes usually go through significant increases or boosts, which is paired with increasing difficulty in the game.
            <p>
                While RPGs were intially played as board games, their online counterparts have done just as well in telling stories, showcasing character development, and creating vast fantasy worlds. With combat being a integral part of RPGs, developers have been challenged to push out games that build through combat, strategy, and narrative.

                    <h3>World of Warcraft (2004)</h3>
                    <p>
                        World of Warcraft basically redefined how RPGs were made. While WoW's innovations were not completely original, they overall created a model for the genre and made a new way for RPGs to be played. Players in WoW control a character who they use to explore landscapes, battle monsters, complete quests, and interact with NPC's. The game is so successful that to this day, it still receives regular updates and expansions, which truly shows how important it is to the RPG Genre as a whole.
