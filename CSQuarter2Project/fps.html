            <h2>FPS Games</h2>
            <p>
                FPS Games are games that are centered on gun fights or other weapon-based combat through a first-person perspective. Like other shooter genres, FPS games involve an avatar, one or more ranged weapons, and a varying number of enemies. Another way first-person and third-person shooter games are similar are in the 3D environments that these games take place in, which provide more realistic lighting, sound effects, and collisions when compared to 2D Games.

                FPS Games usually focus on action gampelay, with fast-paced fights and dynamic firefights being a central component of these games. In addition to firearms, some FPS Games also utilize melee combat, giving games an entire new way that it can be played. Certain FPS Games may also extensively utilize narrative, problem-solving, and puzzles.

                Due to their nature of using 3D graphics, FPS games have contributed in pushing game technology further. FPS games have also progressively incorporated more aspects such as narrative and puzzle through their history, creating perfect blends of gameplay and story through the process.

                    <h3>Wolfenstein 3D (1992)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Wolfenstein has been credited as "The father of 3D Shooter" but moreso first-person shooters, since it established the fast-paced action and technical prowess that is common in the genre today. In this game, players clear levels of differing difficulty by reaching specific "elevators". While doing this though, players have to fight off dogs, guards, and other enemies.

                    <h3>Doom (1993)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Known as "The most important FPS game in history", Doom set the standard for FPS Games. In Doom, players clear levels of varying difficulty while fighting off enemies and managing health, ammunition, and armor. The games success was so important to the genre that for a time, new FPS Games were simply referred to as "Doom Clones" instead of FPS Games.
