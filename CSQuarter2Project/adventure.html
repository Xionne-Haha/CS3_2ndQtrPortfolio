            <h2>Adventure Games</h2>
            <p>
                Adventure games focus on exploration, narrative, and puzzle-solving, immersing players in richly detailed worlds and stories. Unlike action games, adventure titles prioritize discovery and interaction with characters and environments. Players are encouraged to investigate, collect items, and unravel mysteries as they progress through the game.

            <p>
                The genre is known for its emphasis on storytelling, with many adventure games featuring branching narratives and meaningful choices. Dialogue, character development, and world-building are central to the experience, allowing players to become deeply invested in the game's plot and setting. Puzzles and challenges are designed to stimulate critical thinking rather than reflexes.
