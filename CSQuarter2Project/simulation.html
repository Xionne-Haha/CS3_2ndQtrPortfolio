            <h2>Simulation Games</h2>
            <p>
                Simulation video games are a diverse super-category of video games, generally designed to closely simulate real world activities. A simulation game attempts to copy various activities from real life in the form of a game for various purposes such as training, analysis, prediction, or entertainment. Usually there are no strictly defined goals in the game, and the player is allowed to control a character or environment freely.

                Well-known examples are war games, business games, and role play simulation. From three basic types of strategic, planning, and learning exercises: games, simulations, and case studies, a number of hybrids may be considered, including simulation games that are used as case studies.

                There are three types of simulation games: construction games, life simulation and sports. These three have vastly different tasks and goals to take care of but they all ultimately provide the liberty of allowing the player to do whatever he wants in the game, acting as something with just the click of a button.

                    <h3>Euro Truck Simulator 2 (2012)</h3>
                    <p>
                        I never thought the day would come where truck driving would officially be one of the most addictive activities ever but Euro Truck Simulator 2 has proven us wrong. I actually had the pleasure of playing this with my dad when I was still very young. The game is addicting because you can get lost in the long drives in an infinite continent with no end, enabling players to drive to their heart's content.

                    <p>
                        Jurassic World Evolution is a construction and management simulation video game developed and published by Frontier Developments. Based on the 2015 film Jurassic World, the game was released in June 2018, for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. A Nintendo Switch port of the game was released in November 2020. In the game, players construct a dinosaur park on Las Cinco Muertes Archipelago, a group of five islands also known as the "Five Deaths". The game features more than 40 types of dinosaurs; their genes can be modified to introduce new features. Players are given contracts to fulfill by three divisions, Science, Security and Entertainment, allowing them to progress.
