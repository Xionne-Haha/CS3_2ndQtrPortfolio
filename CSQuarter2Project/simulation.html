            <h2>Simulation Games</h2>
            <p>
                Simulation Games are a diverse super-category of video games, generally designed to closely simulate real-world activities. A simulation game attempts to copy various activities from real life in the form of a game for various purposes such as training, analysis, or prediction. Usually, there are no strictly defined goals in the game, with the player instead allowed to freely control a character or environment.

            <p>
                These games can range from managing complex systems, such as cities or businesses, to mimicking specific physical activities like driving, flying, or farming. The core appeal often lies in the satisfaction of optimization, growth, and the realistic cause-and-effect relationship of the game mechanics.

            <p>
                On handheld consoles like the Game Boy, simulation games had to be creative with limited hardware. Despite the lack of high-end processing power for physics, developers created deep, engaging management sims that allowed players to build worlds and manage lives on the go.

                    <h3>SimCity (1989)</h3>
                    <p>
                        While originally a PC title, the Game Boy version of SimCity was a marvel of engineering. Players take on the role of mayor, tasked with building a city from the ground up. You must manage power grids, zoning for residential and industrial areas, and disaster control. It proved that complex management simulations could work perfectly on a portable screen.

                    <h3>Harvest Moon GB (1997)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Harvest Moon defined the farming simulation sub-genre. The game focuses on a relaxing, repetitive loop where the player restores a dilapidated farm. By clearing land, planting crops, raising livestock, and selling produce, players experience a "life sim" that focuses on time management and routine rather than combat or high scores.
