            <h2>FPS Games</h2>
            <p>
                A first-person shooter (FPS) is a video game centered on gun fighting and other weapon-based combat seen from a first-person perspective, with the player experiencing the action directly through the eyes of the main character. This genre shares multiple common traits with other shooter games, and in turn falls under the action games category but has become famous and loved enough to be considered its own genre.
            <p>
                First-person shooters are a major type of shooter game that relies on a first-person point of view with which the player experiences the action through the eyes of the character. They differ from third-person shooters in that, in a third-person shooter, the player can see the character they are controlling (usually from behind, or above). The primary design focus is combat, mainly involving firearms or other types of long range weapons.
            <p>
                A defining feature of the genre is "player-guided navigation through a three-dimensional space." This is a defining characteristic that clearly distinguishes the genre from other types of shooting games that employ a first-person perspective, including light gun shooters, rail shooters, shooting gallery games, or older shooting electro-mechanical games. First person-shooter games are thus categorized as being distinct from light gun shooters, a similar genre with a first-person perspective which uses dedicated light gun peripherals, in contrast to the use of conventional input devices.

                    <h3>Doom (1993)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Known as "The most important FPS game in history", Doom set the standard for FPS Games. In Doom, players clear levels of varying difficulty while fighting off enemies and managing health, ammunition, and armor. The games success was so important to the genre that for a time, new FPS Games were simply referred to as "Doom Clones" instead of FPS Games.
